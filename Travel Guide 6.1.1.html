	<h2>Do I need a visa?</h2>
	<p>If you’re visiting Prague from overseas, use Schengen Visa info to see if you need a visa. Find more information on Schengen Visa online.</p>
	<h2>When is the best time to visit?</h2>
	<p>Summer is Prague’s busiest season and offers the best weather, with temperatures reaching highs of 75°F (25°C) and lows around 55°F (12°C). Major events throughout the year include the Czech Beer Festival in May and the Signal Light Festival in October.</p>
	<p>Prague is also popular over the holiday season, when Christmas markets and festive illuminations show the Old Town at its most atmospheric. During the holiday season, Prague sees highs around 35°F (2°C) and lowest temperatures of 23°F (-5°C).</p>
	<h2>What is the currency?</h2>
	<p>The currency in London is Czech Koruna (CZK). Some larger hotels and restaurants may accept the euro, however, it is not widely accepted. If you do choose to pay in euros, the exchange rate is often less than favorable.</p>
