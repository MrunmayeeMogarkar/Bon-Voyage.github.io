	<p>The palace has always been a site of historical importance. The Palace of Versailles was the principal royal residence of France from 1682, under Louis XIV, until the start of the French Revolution in 1789, under Louis XVI. It is located in Île-de-France about 20 kilometres southwest of the centre of Paris. In 1661, Louis XIV first carried out the expansion work here. Before that, it was just A simple hunting lodging and a small château with a moat.In 1682, when the palace had become large enough, the king moved the entire royal court and the French government to Versailles. Some of the palace furniture at this time was constructed of solid silver, but in 1689 much of it was melted down to pay for the cost of war. Subsequent rulers mostly carried out interior remodeling, to meet the demands of changing taste.</p>
