	<p>The Charles Bridge is an old bridge that connects the Old town with Lesser Town. This popular pedestrian bridge is filled with musicians, painters, vendors and tourists during the summertime.Its construction started in 1357 under the King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century.This new bridge was originally called "Stone Bridge" (Kamenný most) or "Prague Bridge" (Pražský most) but has been called "Charles Bridge" since 1870. The Charles Bridge was the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841. This made it the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and other adjacent areas. This connection made Prague important as a trade route, between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
