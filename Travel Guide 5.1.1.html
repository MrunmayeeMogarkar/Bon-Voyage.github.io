	<h2>Do I need a visa?</h2>
	<p>The Netherlands is part of the Schengen Area with many other European countries. This means tourists from certain countries don’t require a visa for trips less than 90 days — as long as your passport is valid for at least six months after your planned departure date. Find more information on Schengen Visa online.</p>
	<h2>When is the best time to visit?</h2>
	<p>Spring (March to May) and Summer (June to August): The spring tulip season — when Keukenhof Gardens opens up and the city is taken over by colorful blooms for the Tulip Festival — is one of the most popular times to visit Amsterdam. Average daytime temperatures in spring reach 55 Fahrenheit (13 Celsius) and lows of 41 Fahrenheit (5 Celsius).</p>
	<p>Summertime is also inevitably crowded, but it’s the most atmospheric time to experience Dutch culture, with dozens of festivals, urban beaches, and open-air cinemas springing up around the capital. Average daytime temperatures in summer reach highs of 70 Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) and lows of 54 Fahrenheit (12 Celsius).</p>
	<h2>What is the currency?</h2>
	<p>The currency in London is The Euro.</p>
