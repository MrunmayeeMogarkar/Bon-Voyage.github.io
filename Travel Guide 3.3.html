	<p>Notre-Dame de Paris, referred to simply as Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité in Paris. It is also considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. The cathedral was consecrated to the Virgin Mary. The most attractive features of the cathedral that set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style are its enormous and colourful rose windows, its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress and naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration. he world's largest organs and its immense church bells. Main features that make the Notre Dame stand out include one of the world's largest organs and the cathedral's immense church bells. The cathedral's construction began in 1160 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely complete by 1260.In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolutionand much of its religious imagery was either damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the site of the coronation of Napoleon I. Popular interest in the cathedral blossomed soon after the publication, of Victor Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris in 1831.</p>
