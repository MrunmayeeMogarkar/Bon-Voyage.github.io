	<h2>Do I need a visa?</h2>
	<p>If you’re visiting Berlin from outside of the EU, check if you need a visa online.</p>
	<h2>When is the best time to visit?</h2>
	<p>Summer (May-September) For weather that’s ideal for sitting in beer gardens and wandering around Berlin’s parks, visit during the summer of months of May to September. To avoid peak crowds, head to the capital outside of the European summer school holidays, which span July and August.</p>
	<p>Berlin hosts an exciting program of cultural events throughout the year as well, including the Festival of Lights and Jazzfest Berlin in October. Or, travelers can browse postcard-worthy Christmas markets in December, and, of course, don’t miss the Berlin International Beer Festival in August.
