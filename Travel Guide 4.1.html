	<p>"London Bridge Is Falling Down,</p>
	<p> Falling Down, Falling Down......."</p>
	<p>Oh..! The epic "LONDON BRIDGE" from our favourite nursery rhyme! The Old London Bridge of nursery rhyme fame dates from 1176, when Peter, a priest and chaplain of St. Maryâ€™s of Colechurch, began construction of the foundation. The current London Bridge was built between 1968 and 1972. It replaced the previous bridge which had stone arches with beams of prestressed concrete reaching 340 feet (104 metres) in the central span. Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, the London Bridge was the only road-crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames.</p>
