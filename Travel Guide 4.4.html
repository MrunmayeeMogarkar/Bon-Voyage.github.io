	<p>The Tower of London, officially known as "Her Majesty's Royal Palace" and "Fortress of the Tower of London", is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The Tower got its name because of the White Tower present in the castle. The castle was built by William the Conqueror in 1078. After it was first built, its main pourpose was of residence for the royal family. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion in the castle. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site. The castle also houses the Crown Jewels.</p>
