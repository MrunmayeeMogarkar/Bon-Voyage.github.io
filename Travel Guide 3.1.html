	<p>The Louvre, or the Louvre Museum, is the world's largest art museum and a historic monument in Paris. A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine River.It covers an area of apx. 72,735 square meters with around 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century. It is located in the Louvre Palace, originally built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection.The biggest attraction in the Lourve Museum is the world famous painting "Mona Lisa" made by the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
