	<p>The London Eye, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel. It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, with over 3 million visitors annually. The structure is 135 metres tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres. When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Although, it was surpassed by the 160-metre Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 165-metre Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 167-metre-tall High Roller in 2014. Supported by an only an A-frame on one side, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as "the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel". The London Eye used to offer the highest public viewing point in London until it was surpassed by the 245-metre-high observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, that opened to the public on 1 February 2013.</p>
