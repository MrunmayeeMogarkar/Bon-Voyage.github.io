	<p>Petrin Lookout Tower, is located at Petrin Hill, on the left bank of the Vltava river. Its obvious that due to its location and height, it has the advantage of the best, unobstructed and magnificent view of the city. Here you can enjoy the small funicular ride to reach the Petrin Hill. The final stop of the funicular ride is called Petrin LD. It is closer to the Lookout Tower. It has certian similarity to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. However, there are also differences. Its cross section is octagonal and not square like the Eiffel Tower. Also the Tower does not stand on four columns of lattice steel unlike Eiffel Tower. The Tower was designed by the Czech architect, Vratislav Pasovsky. The construction was completed in 1981. </p>
