	<p>Big Ben is the nickname for the "Great Bell of the striking clock" at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London. It is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower.  The tower in which Big Ben is located was originally known as the "Clock Tower". It was renamed as the "Elizabeth Tower" in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-Gothic style which was completed in 1859. Its clock was the largest and most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world. The tower stands 315 feet tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39 feet on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary. Big Ben is the largest of the tower's five bells and weighs 13.5 long tons. It was the largest bell in the United Kingdom for 23 years.</p>
