	<p>The Old Town Square (Staromestske Namesti) is the oldest and most significant square in the historical centre of Prague. It is one of the most important tourist attractions. The important highlight of Old Town Square is famous Prague Astronomical Clock. The Old Town Square's history dates back to the 10 <sup>th</sup> century, when it served as a marketplace at the crossroads of the European trade routes. In addition to the Old Town Hall and the Church of "Our Lady before Týn", the square is dominated by the Baroque Church of St Nicholas, the Rococo Kinský Palace, the Gothic House at the Stone Bell and the monument to Jan Hus. In the pavement of the square are memorial stones marking the execution of 27 Czech lords in 1621, and the Prague meridian.</p>
